# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Install all the dependecies

`npm install`
- install all dependencies into the project. 

# Run the application

`npm run dev`
- run the application.
- please read this doc for more detail [link](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) 

# Deploy the application

`npm run build`
- the output will be stored at "disk" folder.

# Test the App Locally

`npm run build`, then `npm run preview`

- The vite preview command will boot up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at http://localhost:4173. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
